# LevitateOS v0.1.0-alpha: "The Shell Release"

## 🚀 Overview

LevitateOS has reached its first major milestone: **The Shell Release**. This version successfully boots to a userspace environment, starts an `init` process, and spawns an interactive shell (`lsh`) with a set of core utilities.

This release represents the culmination of 8 development phases, transitioning from a bare-metal kernel to a functional, multitasking operating system with Linux ABI compatibility.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🖥️ Userspace & Interactive Shell
*   **Interactive Shell (`lsh`)**: A fully functional shell with command history, line editing, and built-in help.
*   **Init System**: Proper process management starting with PID 1 (`init`).
*   **Core Utilities (`levbox`)**: Implementation of standard tools including `ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `help`, `pwd`, and `clear`.
*   **GPU Terminal**: ANSI-compatible terminal emulator rendering directly to the VirtIO GPU framebuffer.

### 🏗️ Kernel & Architecture
*   **Multi-Architecture Support**: Native support for **AArch64** (QEMU `virt`, Pixel 6) and experimental support for **x86_64** (QEMU `q35`, Intel NUC).
*   **Linux ABI Compatibility**: Targeted syscall interface allowing the porting of standard Rust applications.
*   **Preemptive Multitasking**: Round-Robin scheduler with context switching and timer-based preemption.
*   **Virtual Memory**: Higher-half kernel architecture with advanced MMU management (2MB block optimizations).

### 💾 Filesystem & I/O
*   **Virtual Filesystem (VFS)**: Unified file abstraction layer supporting multiple filesystem types.
*   **Tmpfs**: High-performance in-memory filesystem for temporary storage.
*   **Initramfs**: CPIO-based initial ramdisk for early userspace deployment.
*   **VirtIO Drivers**: Robust drivers for GPU (framebuffer), Input (keyboard/tablet), and Block (storage).

### 🛠️ Hardware Support
*   **AArch64**: Full GICv2/GICv3 auto-detection, PL011 UART, and Generic Timer support.
*   **x86_64**: APIC/IOAPIC initialization, serial console, and initial ACPI support.

## 📦 Getting Started

To run the shell in QEMU (AArch64):

```bash
cargo xtask run
```

To interact via VNC (for GPU output):

```bash
cargo xtask run-vnc
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap Progress
*   **Phase 8 (Completed)**: Userspace foundation, Process management, and Interactive Shell.
*   **Current Focus**: Phase 10 (ulib) and Phase 11 (levbox expansion).
*   **Next Milestone**: Full Rust `std` library support and `uutils` integration.

## 🤝 Acknowledgments
This release was made possible by the collective effort of over 300 development teams, ensuring a debt-free, modular architecture and high quality through rigorous behavior testing.
