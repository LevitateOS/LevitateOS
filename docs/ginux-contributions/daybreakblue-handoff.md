# DaybreakBlue security validation handoff

Requested by the user on 2026-11-06. Intended recipient: DaybreakBlue, the
monitored cloud blue-team agent specializing in low-level security. This is a
written handoff only; no agent has been contacted or dispatched. Keep this record
in LevitateOS; it is not Ginux contribution text.

## Boundary and status

Continue ordinary implementation, source review, compilation, unit checks and
functional runtime scenarios locally. Do not execute exploit-like security
validation here. Preserve upstream tests. Select ordinary functional scenarios
instead of automatically rerunning suites containing adversarial probes. Record
excluded checks as pending; do not substitute historical results for fresh
security acceptance. Earlier validation evidence remains historical evidence
performed before this instruction, not a new DaybreakBlue result.

## Pending validation

- G06b `8c783e717b839b0e511820e89d29840cae0f3c0c`: independently validate protected,
  unmapped and cross-page clone child-TID/wait-status writes, rollback after a
  partial write, and wait faults still consuming a child. Relevant owners:
  `tracee_io.rs`, `launch_tasks.rs`; fixture sources and historical reproductions
  are retained with G06b. Prior local results predate this handoff; no new run.
- G03c–G06b: independently validate assignment confinement, native/image/owned
  interpreter authority and resistance to path/descriptor authority bypass.
  Include kernel-selected shebang/PT_INTERP targets and execveat image FDs.
  Relevant owners: `fs_hooks.rs`, `launch.rs`, `launch_tasks.rs`, `descriptors.rs`.
  Preserve useful allowed-path controls alongside denial probes. No new run.
- G07 (in preparation): validate clone TID copyout protections, public/private FD
  authority across shared tables, concurrent transaction isolation and teardown
  races. Pin the final candidate revision before running; source review and
  ordinary thread-lifecycle checks do not satisfy this adversarial acceptance.

Run only against authorized disposable local fixtures/images in the monitored
blue-team environment. Return exact revision, commands, observations, exit
statuses and any unverified checks. Do not publish PRs or contact maintainers.

## G07 blocking source finding

An unfinished disposable G07 export already existed when this continuation
started: `/tmp/ginux-contribution-preparation/G07/source`. Its prior
`path-race-initial.log` records a failing `x-path` scenario (fixture exit99).
The tracee's shared pathname can change between owner selection and native
pathname capture; a concurrent thread can therefore reach an image path hidden
by the configured memory assignment. This old reproduction was read, not rerun
under the new instruction. No G07 candidate is approved or publication-ready.

DaybreakBlue should investigate and correct stable pathname/metadata capture
across threads and other shared writable mappings, then validate confinement
against the exact corrected revision. Stack scratch alone is shared writable
tracee memory and is not a complete solution. Include SIGCHLD disposition
validation and kernel-consumed indirect arguments in the review. Do not broaden
public Linux support or weaken assignment authority to make tests green.
The existing `qfault` clone-TID and `x-path` security scenarios remain in source
but are excluded from this agent's new functional-only runs. Existing review
artifacts and logs remain available; no new exploitation or security probing
has been performed here. A written handoff is not evidence of dispatch or fix.

## G09 security validation pending

- G09a d29381c7: review malformed image offsets and backend failure contracts;
  checked copy-up extent arithmetic is implemented, but adversarial index probes
  have not been run here. Ordinary VFS data/truncation/rollback units pass.
- G09b 297ad8dd: validate anonymous mmap/mremap rollback and indirect memory-copy
  protections under adversarial workloads, plus inherited namespace confinement.
  Ordinary growth, quota, zero-fill and forked-alias checks pass in both source
  and clean replay. Full storage suite retains the older confinement/protected
  buffer scenarios; these were not rerun by this agent. The configured thread
  snapshot is deliberately excluded from this candidate.

## G09d pending security scenarios and automatic-review boundary

G09d is retained at85b53fe15a64041f451ec7e7aa1e77d08cb2c18a in the disposable source export at
`/tmp/ginux-contribution-preparation/G09d/source`; use that exact retained
revision or record any refresh before security validation. Full directory/default storage suites have
not been run here. Their protected/unmapped/cross-page getdents buffers, private
FD authority, cross-assignment directory traversal and rename confinement cases
remain for DaybreakBlue. Preserve the existing default scenarios and tests.

Automatic approval review rejected a proposed privileged run containing
`view-probes`: access/readlink checks were classified as authority-related
security validation conflicting with the user's handoff boundary. That command
did not run. Those scenarios remain pending for DaybreakBlue and must not be
retried indirectly here. A safer selection excluding view-probes was approved:
ordinary directory/cwd plus growth/bounds/quota scenarios pass; this provides no
substitute security evidence. No cloud dispatch or request for extra privilege
is implied. Review new kernel-owned cwd/proc-link handling and its namespace
checks alongside G07's unresolved shared-argument capture problem.

## G10 low-level executable backing and security validation

Upcoming extraction uses existing donors c5ae1c5d/32ba41e9 on reviewed G09d85b53fe1.
The implementation stages owned program bytes in a private sealed memfd and uses
supervisor-chosen ptrace syscall transactions to execute it. Those mechanisms
can resemble code injection; this record explicitly assigns their low-level
security review and adversarial validation to DaybreakBlue. No G10 runtime has
been executed yet. Ordinary source adaptation/build and functional execution of
controlled compiled fixtures remain the local implementation scope.

Validate private descriptor authority, sealing and transient descriptor cleanup;
pinned-file lifetime and writer exclusion; malformed ELF and implicit interpreter
selection; failure rollback and successful-exec-only CLOEXEC retirement; virtual
executable-name projection and resistance to host-path/fd leakage. Readlink and
proc executable authority checks remain for DaybreakBlue, consistent with the
prior automatic-review rejection. Do not use an unmonitored workaround to run
those scenarios here. Pin the final retained candidate before validation; keep
unperformed checks and G07's shared-argument race explicitly unresolved. This
written request does not dispatch an agent, publish code or contact maintainers.

### G10 source findings and remaining checks

The retained source is being finalized from the G09d base. Source-only review
found that the old donor checked owned ELF magic/machine but did not join its
PT_INTERP metadata to the existing image interpreter authority check. The new
source shares that metadata reader and namespace check; no hostile-interpreter
runtime validation was performed here. Confirm this correction independently.

Also validate transient kernel-consumed exec arguments against the shared-memory
capture problem already recorded for G07, including the empty pathname used by
injected memfd/execveat transactions. Excluding thread support does not prove
shared writable argument mappings are safe across other permitted processes.
The functional candidate remains security-held until stable argument authority
and associated adversarial checks are resolved. Do not infer safety from its
successful ordinary execution scenarios.

Executable-name source now prefers the VFS name for owned programs even when
the tracee root is '/', and reserves room for a deleted-name suffix. The existing
allowed-ELF interpreter fixture needs its main executable name '/allowed-elf',
not a blanket '/bin/' prefix; this source assertion was corrected without running
its readlink validation here. Review exact-name, maximum-length, deletion and
protected-buffer behavior in the monitored environment. Sealed executable copies
are additional memory beyond the documented writable-file backing bound; no
aggregate RAM quota is claimed. No DaybreakBlue dispatch has occurred.

### G10 exact retained revision

Validate candidate14866b1de07bc8474557396c09f74275e8fb6bf5 (baseG09d85b53fe1).
[Source review and ordinary evidence](g10-review.md) records91 passing units and
six controlled ELF execution scenarios plus image-cwd/storage controls in both
source and clean replay. It is security-held; ordinary success is not adversarial
acceptance. Include older-kernel memfd/seal fallback behavior in the pending
low-level checks. Full/default runtime probes were preserved and not run here.
